<p>The purpose of this generator is to create blog titles. I had a little help making this from people on a forum. I used to have to type each blog title individually, but that took a long time. This tool has drastically increased my productivity, as the task it's used for was taken from around 8 hours to around 3 hours. <br/>
Currently I can only get this to work in Chrome.</p>
